# Lab Homework 2 – Encoding Categorical Data

This project is part of CIS 550-7101: Advanced Machine Learning (Summer 2025).  
It demonstrates encoding techniques for both ordinal and nominal categorical data using the imports-85 automobile dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 🧪 What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Applied ordinal encoding to features like `num-of-doors` and `num-of-cylinders`
- Applied one-hot encoding to non-ordinal features like `aspiration` and `drive-wheels`
- Completed a challenge task by adding and encoding two more features
- Documented the process with screenshots and a full report
